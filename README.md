# QA472-Draft
Drafting documentation for the QA472

## View documentation

Docs are being hosted (for now) at [https://excitonlabs.github.io/QA472-Draft](https://excitonlabs.github.io/QA472-Draft).

## mkdocs with material theme

Documentation is written in markdown and [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) is used to generate a static website that is hosted using GitHub Pages.

To build a local version of the documentation download and install mkdocs (it is a command line tool) as well as the [material theme]
(https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

Run the command

    mkdocs serve
    
This will serve the files at http://localhost:8000 and hot reload on any changes.
